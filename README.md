ðŸ“Œ Notes

  Ensure MySQL is running and the ordering_system_db database is created manually if migrations are not used.

  The backend serves as an API; all user interaction happens via the Vue frontend.

  Make sure CORS is properly configured in Laravel (app/Http/Middleware/HandleCors.php) if you run into frontend-backend communication issues.
